Ideas/TODO

Steps:

1. Edit the sections and problems in a section to reflect completion and date of completion
    - Options for sections:
    - https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/examples/kitchen-sink
    - only editable field is "completed", no need to make anything else editable
    - this field can change onselection

2. Problem set, be able to create a new one or complete an existing one, marker at problem left off on
   1. logic for set selection should skew in reasonable ways
   2. selection of problems should guarantee the first n and then pick randomly?
3. Complete the personal data tab, add all metrics desired
4. Complete the About page, add description of the project, tech used, how to use
5. Ingests tab, includes description of ingests format, does validation
6. Add support for Linear Algebra Done right, probably by removing all hardcoding that cares precisely what books there are in there
7. Unify styling
   1. pluralsight styling with react course
   2. inspiration for style like the best parts of mathematics professors' janky old websites 
8. User login and secret management
9. testing and perf testing and bug bash
10. Think devops and deployment
11. Writeup of project with experience gained etc.
