# Feature Planning


Step 1: Get to basic functionality with poor design and understanding of the dependencies and framerwork tools being used. Just have a version of the thing that works pretty well and does what I need.

## Books Page

My Library:

Book Cards
- hamburger menu
  - Delete option (with an are you sure)
  - edit book data
  - see more data (In MY data page)
- Delete button (like hamburger menu)
- Add date added to personal book data model and add this to display
- Add description of the book to the card, pulled from the book data model.

Public Library
- Add a big table with all the books in the public library, and basic data about them
  - have it so that each row can be selected and bring up the book cover and the remaining interesting info that didnt fit in the table in some main display space
- check box to add to personal library (already checked out if in possession)


Problem Set
- change page from "current problem set" to "Problem sets" and then have a page for current and a selector for old ones as well, as well as some summary data about problem completion
